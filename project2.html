    <h1>Stage at Bending Spoons</h1>
    <div class="margin-progects">
    <h3 class="subtitle"> On July 4, 2020, I successfully completed my second curricular internship at Bending Spoons as UI/UX designer, acquired many important skills and became a junior UI/UX designer.</h3>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Bending Spoons S.p.A. is an Italian <strong> mobile application developer </strong>, founded in 2013 and based in Milan. The company is known primarily for iOS mobile apps, including Splice, 30 Day Fitness, and Live Quiz. Bending Spoons is one of the world's leading mobile developers, by number of app downloads</p>
    <p>During these internships, I learned many different design techniques such as: <strong>User Flow Map, Personas, Mobile UI, UX Basics, Landing Page, Personal Branding, Logo Design, Lettering, Typography Exercises</strong> and <strong>Developing</strong> my own <strong> Mobile App.</strong></p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>During my first internship, I had just entered the world of UI/UX design, so I didn't have enough experience to create a good and unique design, so I just wanted to get as much experience as possible. So I will not focus so much at my first internship</p>
    <h2 class="subdivider">Second internship</h2>
    <p>First, I showed my to my superiors my projects that I did after the first internship to show where I came up, in a way to see what I need to improve and what my design weaknesses are.
        I really enjoyed this experience.
        Along the way, I will explain what I did during the internship, let's get started.</p>
        <p><strong>Projects:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>UI Exercises</p></li>
            <li><p>Landing Pages</p></li>
            <li><p>Personal Branding</p></li>
            <li><p>EasyCook</p></li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="subdivider">UI Exercises</h3>
    <img src="Assets/Images/First Exersise.png" alt="">
    <p>This was my first exercise, I needed to create a UI for mobile applications based on projects already created by other people, the most important was to use and understand how some features in Figma work, such as Auto-layout and Components. This exercise was done according to all the rules that are required in Bending Spoons, taking into account the design rules and convenience not only for designers, but also for developers.</p>
    
    <h3 class="subdivider">Landing Pages</h3>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="Assets/Images/Landin Pages Ex.png" alt=""></div>
    <p>In this exercise, I create a landing page by focusing on the font, keeping in mind the text hierarchy and how different fonts can be combined and used together.</p>

    <h3 class="subdivider">Personal Branding</h3>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="Assets/Images/Personal Branding.png" alt=""></div>
    <p style="text-align:center ;">When I made my personal logo, I tried to bring my own personality to it.I made many versions for my branding but ended up with these two versions.I'm so happy with the end result.</p>

    <h1 class="subdivider">EasyCook</h1>
    <p>My final work was to <strong>create my own mobile application </strong>, I start with 3 app ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>The first idea was to create a running app, I wanted to create a running app where people could meet and run together using the app.</p></li>
        <li><p>Second Idea has been created a cooking app, with recipes, but with more functions such as sorting the foods that are missing for the selected recipe, creating a shopping list, where you can also put the expiry data of the foods in your refrigerator and many other functions.</p></li>
        <li><p>And the latest idea was to create a platform similar to Change.org, but for mobile devices and make it anonymous and where people could discuss a lot of different topics and create polls.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>But in the end, I chose the cooking app.</p>
            <h2 class="subdivider">Initial Process</h2>
            <p> Before starting to design of the app, I needed to collect as much information about users as possible in order to know what to focus on, which features I would use, and which ones would be ineffective and generally unnecessary for the application.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I created a questionnaire through Google Forms and received more than fifty answers from a completely different sample of age, sex and marital status, then I analyzed the data and was able to understand what users need</p>
            <p>We also created MVP, Personas and User Flowmap.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>MVP</strong> (minimum viable product) design is a process for creating functional, production-ready products that serve user needs. Prototypes are not fully functional, nor are they ready for production. In some cases, minimum viable prototypes are created which are like a hybrid of the two.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Personas</strong> are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. Creating personas helps the designer to understand users' needs, experiences, behaviors and goals.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>User flow</strong> is a process or path taken by a prototypical user on a website or app to complete a task. The user flow takes a user from an entry point through a set of steps towards a successful outcome and final action, such as completion of order. As a designer, you must be clear about what you're working on.</p></li>
                </ul>

        <h2>UX Process</h2>
        <p>For a designer, User experience(UX) design is the process to create products which provide meaningful, relevant and flexible experiences to users. This involves the whole design process of collecting and uniting the product, including aspects like branding, design, usability, accessibility and functionality.</p>
        <p>When I was confident in the ideas, I started with UX design without concentrating on the visual part of the application, because in the beginning it is important that the design works and the user feels comfortable when using the application.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center ;">Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="margin-progects"> <p style="text-align:center ;">I am very happy with the final version of the design and this internship taught me a lot, I am very grateful to Bending Spoons for the opportunity they gave me and thanks to which I received a very important unforgettable experience.</p>    </div>
