    <h1>Voice Out</h1>
    <div class="margin-progects">
    <h3 class="subtitle">This project was made for ENTEINE (The European Training Network on Informal Care)</h3>

    <h2>About ENTWINE</h2>
    <p>ENTWINE is a 4-year Marie Skłodowska-Curie <strong> Innovation Training Network</strong> (ITN), funded by the European Union and started as of September 2018. The Network will train 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) for high quality PhD training.</p>
    <p>Mostly due to increased longevity and medical advances, the needs of older/ill individuals for long-term care rise rapidly while the <strong>availability of informal caregivers decreases </strong>. Informal caregivers are those who provide unpaid care to a relative or friend with a chronic illness, disability or other long-lasting health or care need. This “Care Gap” will create <strong>huge problems</strong> for the sustainability of European health care systems that rely heavily on the provision of informal care.</p>
    <p>The <strong> aim of ENTWINE’s </strong> team is to investigate broad spectrum of challenges in informal caregiving and issues concerning the development and use of innovative psychology-based and technology-based interventions that support willingness and opportunity to provide informal care.</p>
    <p>The focus is on overcoming barriers following a user-centered, stakeholder-driven implementation and agile science approach to promote the adoption and implementation of <strong>innovative solutions to support informal caregivers</strong>. ENTWINE represents a stepping stone towards sustainable informal care throughout Europe.</p>
    <h2>About Voice Out</h2>
    <p>Voice Out it's a <strong>website for informal caregivers</strong> (people who care for their loved ones elderly), it uses principles of narrative therapy and transformative storytelling technique I developed to allow caregivers to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>1. Listen to therapeutic ready stories </p></li>
        <li><p>2. Record their own stories and if they want to share on the website or download </p></li>
        <li><p>3. Have a page from where they can obtain info on how to connect to the caregiving community.</p></li>
    </ul>
    
        <h1>First versions</h1>
    <div class="container-imgtxt">
        <div class="text-container">
            <h2>Initial Process</h2>
            <p>These are my first ideas, which I later abandoned, it was very important for me to first design the landing page in order to determine the general mood of the site and how I should do the rest of the pages.</p>
            <p>Some ideas had to be abandoned due to the fact that they did not convey the mood of the site well, I also really liked the version with a white background, but after talking with the client, we decided that the version that is currently used is better suited for this site and I also agree with this.</p>

    <div class="margin">
    <h2>Final Version of Landing</h2>
    <p>I had to do quite a lot of illustrations, but I'm very pleased with the final result.  My client was also very happy with how I made this page.  This page has quite a lot of text and I don't really like that, so I tried to keep the page interesting even if it has a lot of text so I focused a lot on the illustrations, also I was thinking of reducing the amount of text but still it was very important to understand how  working Voice Out.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The client was so pleased with the result that he even invited me to present this project and now I am working with him on another new project called "Round Table".  I am also happy with the project, it was a very interesting experience especially in terms of the fact that I had to present my design.</p>
    <p>This project was amazing to work on. I love working closely with users to understand their problems and interpret them to create beautiful solutions. I believe that this will guide me forward throughout my journey in product design.</p>
